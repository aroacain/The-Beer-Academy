# The-Beer-Academy
In June 2021 I created a product landing page for a fictional Beer academy as part of a Responsive Web Design Certification. I recently revisited the project and decided to re-do the project to practice some newly acquired skills. My main goals were:

To practice using CSS animations. 
To create a mobile friendly navigation bar without using Bootstrap, but using only CSS and Javascript. 
To make the site more mobile friendly by taking better advantage of media queries and flex.
