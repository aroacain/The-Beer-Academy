# The-Beer-Academy
In June 2021 I created a product landing page for a fictional Beer academy as part of my graduation project for the Responsive Web Design Certification. I recently revisited the project and decided to re-do the project to practice my newly acquired skills, including using CSS animations and Javascript to make the navbar mobile friendly. My main goals were:

To practice using CSS animations.
To create a mobile friendly navigation bar without using Bootstrap, but using only CSS and Javascript.
To make the site more mobile friendly by taking better advantage of media queries and flex.
